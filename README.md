# TechLab

I took three weeks of computer courses from TechLab in the summer of 2019.  The courses are in sequence starting with Introduction to Java, Java Silver, and then Java Gold as the final week.  This repo contains projects done in the final week.

Programs written listed in the order of difficulty.  The later projects were built on elements learned in the earlier ones. <br>
<ul>
<li>Checkerboard: build a checkerboard with black and white tiles
<li>Gradient - fill the window with a gradient color
<li>QR_Code - generate a QR code
<li>QR_Code_2D_Array - generate QR code with 2D array so it is faster
<li>Snowflakes - snowflakes of different colors falling from the top of the window
<li>Bouncing Ball - fill the window with a set of randomly colored balls that bounces 
<li>Bouncing Ball2 - learning inheritance and create two balls, one large, and one small that bounces around the window
<li>World - A multi-player simulation where players (from the class) can navigate the world. The program does not work at this moment because it needs to connect to the TechLab server; that portion of the code is commented out.
